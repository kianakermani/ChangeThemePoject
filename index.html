    <p>
      Is there anywhere one can enjoy driving more than in an open top car?
      Feeling the wind, the speed; experiencing the purest sensations of
      acceleration and braking throughout your body. From the very beginning,
      Ettore Bugatti wanted to build cars stripped down to their essence: the
      pure joy of driving, Les Pur-Sangs des Automobiles. He was also known for
      his eccentricities. A pragmatist, but also a perfectionist with a deep
      desire to blaze his own trail. In the same way, Ettore wanted the BUGATTI
      brand to distinguish itself. It could be seen in his clothes as well as in
      the colors he chose for his personal cars.
